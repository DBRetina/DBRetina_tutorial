**DBRetina** is an efficent tool for building a similarity network for a set of items by pairwaise calcuation of their shared features using a linear-time algorithm.

 
In this tutorial, we will use DBRetina to build a disease-disease similairty netwrok based on the shared number of genes asscoiated with them in the DisGeNET database (one of the largest collections of genes associated to human diseases).
